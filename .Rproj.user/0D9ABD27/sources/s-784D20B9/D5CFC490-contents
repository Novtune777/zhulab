**The goal at Zhu Lab**

Is to merge observations, experiments, and models to inform new knowledge of global significance. We use interdisciplinary approaches in ecology, environmental sciences, as well as statistics and data science.

Zhu Lab is located in the [Department of Environmental Studies](https://envs.ucsc.edu/) at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/index.html).

Stay tuned on the latest lab news, find out people and opportunities to join the lab, follow research and publications to learn more about what we do, and check out the teaching resources!
