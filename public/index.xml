      <description>Lab alumnus Chris Zajic was awarded an NSF graduate research fellowship in STEM Education and Learning Research on 4 April 2022. Chris will use the funding provided through the fellowship to investigate the role of social connections in undergraduate life science students’ access to research experiences. This work will be carried out under the guidance of Dr. Erin Dolan at the University of Georgia, where Chris is pursuing a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology.</description>

      <description>Title: Putting microbes on the map: Using neonMicrobe to advance microbial biogeography
Abstract: While the growing availability of marker gene sequencing has created a surge in microbial biogeography research, synthesis across studies has been hindered by the variability among their sampling designs. Elucidating organismal patterns remains especially challenging because it requires a robust method for recognizing when sequences at different sites refer to the same taxa. NEON’s microbial marker gene data product line overcomes these methodological challenges by imposing a standardized sampling design and sequencing protocol across all of its monitoring sites, and the neonMicrobe R package is designed to facilitate access to this data in its raw sequence form—particularly for ecologists without extensive bioinformatics training.</description>

      <description>Dr. Kai Zhu   Kai is interested in global change ecology, ecological modeling, and environmental data science, where he enjoys integrating ecological theory with advanced tools in statistics and computer science. His current research focuses on plant and soil responses to environmental change in the coupled natural and human systems, spanning from meter-scale experiments to global-scale analyses. Kai is a recipient of the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an elected Ecological Society of America Early Career Fellow, and a winner of the New Phytologist Tansley Medal.</description>

      <description>Peter Pellitier   Postdoc, Stanford Biology &amp;amp; UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies
Peter studies plant and fungal interactions, with a particular fondness for the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. He is broadly interested in the functional biogeography of fungal communities, determinants of fungal community assembly, and the role of symbiotic fungi in plant response to climate change. Peter employs large scale field surveys, field and laboratory manipulations, and various DNA sequencing approaches to address fundamental questions in fungal ecology.</description>
