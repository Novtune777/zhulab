      <description>Lab alumnus Chris Zajic was awarded an NSF graduate research fellowship in STEM Education and Learning Research on 4 April 2022. Chris will use the funding provided through the fellowship to investigate the role of social connections in undergraduate life science students’ access to research experiences. This work will be carried out under the guidance of Dr. Erin Dolan at the University of Georgia, where Chris is pursuing a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology.</description>

      <description>Title: Putting microbes on the map: Using neonMicrobe to advance microbial biogeography
Abstract: While the growing availability of marker gene sequencing has created a surge in microbial biogeography research, synthesis across studies has been hindered by the variability among their sampling designs. Elucidating organismal patterns remains especially challenging because it requires a robust method for recognizing when sequences at different sites refer to the same taxa. NEON’s microbial marker gene data product line overcomes these methodological challenges by imposing a standardized sampling design and sequencing protocol across all of its monitoring sites, and the neonMicrobe R package is designed to facilitate access to this data in its raw sequence form—particularly for ecologists without extensive bioinformatics training.</description>
