**Postdoc, Stanford Biology & UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies**


Peter studies plant and fungal interactions, with a particular fondness for the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. He is broadly interested in the functional biogeography of fungal communities, determinants of fungal community assembly, and the role of symbiotic fungi in plant response to climate change. Peter employs large scale field surveys, field and laboratory manipulations, and various DNA sequencing approaches to address fundamental questions in fungal ecology. Peter received his PhD in 2020 advised by Don Zak at the University of Michigan and holds an MS in Post-Secondary Science Education, also from Michigan. Peter joined the Peay Lab at Stanford University as a postdoc, and also works with Kai Zhu at UC Santa Cruz and Rob Jackson at Stanford. In 2021 he will start an NSF PRFB, studying the decay attributes of ECM communities at the continental scale.

**Postdoc, Stanford Biology & UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies**


Michael is an ecologist and evolutionary biologist interested in plant-microbiome relationships. His work combines large-scale observations, mechanistic experiments, and molecular approaches to explore how plants interact with their associated microbes, how these interactions vary under different conditions, and what impact they have on the ecology and evolution of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Michael completed his PhD in the Schweitzer Lab at the University of Tennessee, where he focused on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of plant-soil linkages and their response to global change. Michael is a postdoc in the Peay Lab at Stanford University and working with Kai on the biogeography of plant-fungal symbioses and how they influence species geographic distributions and coexistence.
