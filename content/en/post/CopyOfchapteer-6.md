Lab alumnus Chris Zajic was awarded an NSF graduate research fellowship in STEM Education and Learning Research on 4 April 2022. Chris will use the funding provided through the fellowship to investigate the role of social connections in undergraduate life science students’ access to research experiences. This work will be carried out under the guidance of Dr. Erin Dolan at the University of Georgia, where Chris is pursuing a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology. 

Chris completed his undergraduate research with Kai and Yiluan, and he is a co-author of the 2021 AGU Advances paper. Congratulations, Chris!
